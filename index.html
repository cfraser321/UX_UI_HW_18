                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <img src="images/linedrawing.png">
                <p>I’m a UX/UI Designer based in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. My path into the UX/UI field was a journey that took me across industries, through a variety of areas and roles, and on several scenic detours. Along the way I gained unique transferable skills and worked with many inspiring people and teams everywhere I went.
                </p>
                <p>I am on track to complete my certificate in UX/UI Design through the University of Denver in November 2022. Design is an exciting adventure for me, a chance to explore and continuously learn and apply new technologies, concepts, and techniques. If there’s one thing I’ve learned so far, it’s that a great designer should never be afraid to stop and ask for directions (aka do your research, listen to the user and the client, and adjust accordingly)! It’s crucial to be open to change to make sure your design ends up in the place where both clients and users want it to be. Good thing I love to challenge myself, and I thrive in a dynamic work environment!
                </p> 
                <p>Now I’ve arrived as a designer, but the journey is far from over. Contact me to discuss how we can work together to drive towards the fork in the road where design and usability intersect.
